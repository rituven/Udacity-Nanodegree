1. Sample Data Wrangling Project: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F0Vs14oNEs2idFJR3C_OPxwS6L0HPliOii-QpbmrMo4/pub
2. The MongoDB Manual: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/ 
3. PyMongo Documentation: https://api.mongodb.org/python/current/
4. And not to forget the wonderful 'Data Wrangling in MongoDB' course and all the exercises completed 
   while taking the course.
